## FAQ

Q: Where can I find Haskell libraries I can use with Plutus.
A: We recommend https://hoogle.haskell.org - which allows you to search for functions by type.
   Please keep in mind that Plutus on-chain code will only support a subset of Haskell.
   You might also want to take a look at [awesome-haskell](https://github.com/krispo/awesome-haskell#readme)

Q: How can I write/run Plutus code today?
A: (As of may 19, 2021) - currently Plutus does not have a public test net, Plutus can run in a simulated chain using the Plutus Application backend, or PAB, which is available in the Plutus monorepo.

## Testing
 the Plutus monorepo currently provides two libraries that can be used to write effective tests for your Plutus contract:

- [Wallet Emulator](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/tree/master/plutus-contract/src/Wallet/Emulator) - can easily run tests in an emulated environment.
- [PAB Simulator](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/blob/master/plutus-pab/src/Plutus/PAB/Simulator.hs) - can easily run tests or live interaction via http with a simulated local blockchain which supports Plutus
- [IOHK Tutorial on Testing Plutus Contracts](https://docs.cardano.org/projects/plutus/en/latest/plutus/tutorials/contract-testing.html?highlight=slots) - a tutorial on how to test stateful contracts using quickcheck property testing.
